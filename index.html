          <p>We conducted a competitor analysis and found no consistency in non-profit web presence. This may be due to tight budgets and limited staff. We did not find a competitor analysis to be helpful in our research, and opted instead for literary reviews of non-proft we presence recommendations [as seen in our user flow (v.1)]</p>

          <p>We conducted several 1x1 interviews with users, along with facilitating user tests on the Marian House donation flow. All of our interviewees have expereince donating to a non-profit, 75%Â have experience with online giving. The following insightes were gained:</p>
          <div>  
            <ul>Users felt the donation page looked unsecure</ul>
            <ul>Users felt there were too many steps to get to the donation page</ul>

          <p>The stakeholder already had a good idea of what they wanted to do, and gladly discussed with us the direction they saw the site going. The intended audience of their site are community members and potential donors.<br>The stakeholder expressed discouragement that the current homepage did not present the Marian House mission and value statement well. We discussed the following concerns with them:</p>
          <div>
            <ul>While the intended audience of the site is donors, they see very few donations coming in through the site</ul>
            <ul>Marian House serves a large demographic of women in a myriad of areas, how can we efficiently and clearly demonstrate this on the sites homepage?</ul>
            <ul>Their current site is designed and managed by an outside organization, one the stakeholder feels does not truly understand the heart of Marian House.</ul>
